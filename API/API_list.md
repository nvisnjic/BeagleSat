## Sensors ##

* Requirements *

* Easy access to stored sensor data (both processed and unprocessed)
* Store all data required for real-time correction and postponed correction
* Link processed data to used corr. parameters
* Initiate computation of correction parameters
* Update IGRF reference
* Add/remove time-variant error sources into the model
* Access to correction parameters
* Set type of correction algorithm
* Real-time correction of data (and usage in other processes)
* Control of telemetry input/data
* Connection to Comms?


* Use cases *

* Time-variant correction of real-time sensor data
* Time-variant correction based on previously collected data
* Correction with a different reference IGRF then previously expected
* Transfer via Comms/store/use all sensors/telemetry/parameter data
* 


## Future components##

* Altitude & heading determination based on the data
* Telemetry/Imaging/Power/Navigation/Comms...
