#About
BeagleSat is an open-source nano satellite platform based on the 
BeagleBone embedded development board.
 
It's a framework and tool set for designing your very own CubeSat from the
ground up, while expanding the CubeSat community and bringing space that 
much closer to anyone willing to hack.
